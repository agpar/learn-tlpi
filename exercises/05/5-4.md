Explain what happens have each call to "write".

```
fd1 = open(file, O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
fd2 = dup(fd1);
fd3 = open(file, O_RDWR);
write(fd1, "Hello,", 6);
write(fd2, "world", 6);
lseek(fd2, 0, SEEK_SET);
write(fd1, "HELLO,", 6);
write(fd3, "Gidday", 6);
```

1. The word "Hello," is written to file.
2. The word "world" is written to file, it now is "Hello,world"
3. "HELLO," overwrites "Hello," in file, as fd1 and fd2 share an offset.
4. "Gidday" overwrite "HELLO" in file, as fd3 has it's own offset.
